Because Father Joe Biden has stubs for legs there was a brick on the gas pedal and you drove uncontrollably hitting a tree. You wake up and you are deep in the middle of the woods during the morning with just a computer terminal that is your only way to buy and sell. You can only hold limited resources and have to sell them to get money to build your shelter. Once nighttime comes Father Joe Biden is back on the hunt. Avoid Joe Biden throughout the night so you can survive another day. Once the morning comes Father Biden is teleported back to the White House and you are given another day to prepare.

Losing Mechanic: 
After you get caught by Father Biden, you are brought into the basement that Joe Biden has kept deep in the woods as his hideout. You have to escape his hideout for another chance at freedom.
